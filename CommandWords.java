/**
 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 * 
 * This class holds a map mapping all command words to functions that
 * return a new Instance of the according Command implementation.
 * It is used to recognise commands as they are typed in.
 * The getCommand(commandWord,parameter) method returns a new instance of the
 * matching Command (Instance of a concrete Subclass of Command)
 * 
 * CommandWords is an enum with just one instance.
 * This makes it easy to access it from anywhere/
 * all other classes in the program via
 * CommandWords.INSTANCE
